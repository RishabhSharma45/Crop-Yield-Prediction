# Crop-Yield-Prediction
Welcome to the AI-ML Crop Yield Prediction Project! This repository features a machine learning model that forecasts agricultural crop yields using environmental and historical data, aimed at aiding farmers, agronomists, and researchers in enhancing crop management and productivity.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Identify critical data features.
Model Training: Deploy multiple machine learning algorithms to find the most effective predictor.
Evaluation: Use various metrics to assess model performance.
Prediction: Generate yield predictions with the trained models.

# Technologies
Languages: Python 3.x
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib
Dataset
The models use a dataset with features like weather conditions and soil properties. Raw data files are not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.
